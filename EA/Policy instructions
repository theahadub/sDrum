Running Adobe Remote Update Manager can take a few minutes and is not good to run in an Extension Attribute.  Instead, make a policy to figure out the count.

Create a new policy.

Set your trigger and frequency.  Also set your scope (no need to run on devices that do not have Adobe products)

In Files and Processes, go to the bottom and put in Execute Command

  sudo /usr/local/bin/RemoteUpdateManager --action=list | grep "(" | wc -l  | awk '{$1=$1};1' > /var/log/rumcount.txt

Save your policy.

A bug in this is sometimes it will report back 2 when there really is 0.  

Now make a smart group that reads the value of the EA and then you can run sdrum when there are updates available.
